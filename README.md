- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwm5749
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to make my Tandem T:slim X2 insulin pump automatically load all of my treatments into Nightscout without a delay.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java but I just started so I am extremely novice.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ControlX2 and/or Tconnectsync.  Even though I am a novice I am willing to help in any way possible.
- 📫 How to reach me, I can be emailed at jwm5749@gmail.com
